# Et'slay Avehay Omesay Unfay!
Welcome to Fulcrum's first Mini-Hackathon! This repo contains some stub files to get you started on a little Pig Latin project.

Your job, with your partner and during the time alotted, is to write a Pig Latin translator that will run when you open `igpay.html` in your browser.

##Translator Requirements:
- Accept an english language string from the user
- Translate that string into Pig Latin, and display it

##Extra credit:
- Allow the user to translate multiple strings without refreshing the page
- Make it pretty!
- Translate from Pig Latin back into english

##The rules of Pig Latin:
- Words beginning with a consonant that consonant moved to the end of the word and followed by "ay". 
*Examples: "pig" -> "igpay", "javascript" -> "avascriptjay"* 

- Groups of consonants are moved together. 
*Examples: "string" -> "ingstray", "slice" -> "iceslay"*

- Words that begin in vowels should just get "yay" added to the end. 
*Examples: "object" -> "objectyay",  "array" -> "arrayyay"*

##Good luck, and happy Latining!
